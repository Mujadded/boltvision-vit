# BoltVision: High Accuracy Classification of Missing Bolts in Train Components

## Introduction
BoltVision is a comparative analysis of various machine learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCTs), aimed at accurately classifying missing bolts in train components. This repository contains the code and models used in the study published in Machines (MDPI). For more information, read our paper: [BoltVision: A Comparative Analysis of CNN, CCT, and ViT](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1702/12/2/93).


## Setup
We would need pytorch mainly for this, we also have some model with tensorflow

## Usage
Different models are in different files to test properly. The file names are a good indication.


## Data
Not including the dataset and university has the rights to it

## Results
This study illustrates the superior assessment capabilities of these models and discusses their effectiveness in addressing the prevalent issue of edge devices. Results show that BoltVision, utilising a pre-trained ViT base, achieves a remarkable 93% accuracy in classifying missing bolts.
